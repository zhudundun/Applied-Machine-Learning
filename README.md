### HW1: Naive Bayes classifier
The UC Irvine machine learning data repository hosts a collection of data on student performance in Portugal.
Build and evaluate a naive Bayes classifier from scratch for prediction. 
For binary attributes, use a binomial model. For numeric attributes, use a normal model or multinomial model and compare. 

### HW1: Support vector machine
The UC Irvine machine learning data repository hosts a collection of data on adult income. 
Write a program to train a support vector machine from scratch on this data using stochastic gradient descent. 


### HW3
Obtain the iris dataset from the UC Irvine machine learning data repository. Investigate the use of principal components to smooth data.
